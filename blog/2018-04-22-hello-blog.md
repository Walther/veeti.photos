Spring is the time of new things coming to life. Inspired by the bright, warm sunlight and various blogs of fellow photographers, I decided it was finally time to start a proper blog.

Recently, I've been reading and watching a lot of photography-related content. Among others, the blogs of [A.B. Watson](http://www.abwatson.com/blog/) and [Eric Kim](http://erickimphotography.com/blog/) planted a vision to my brain: I should create a proper website and start blogging.

## Why write a blog?

Writing a blog is a process. It's probably worth experiencing in the same way as e.g. making darkroom prints is -- learning new things and practicing various different aspects of photography as a whole will keep your mind fresh. In addition to the abstract, there are some practical benefits too:

* On a personal website you own, you have ultimate freedom on the content and how to display it
* A blog post can be a coherent whole, with arranged and captioned images
* A blog post even allows for longer paragraphs of text, if you want to explain your thought processes
* You can focus on creating something you enjoy and like, you don't need to [maximize virality](https://markmanson.net/6-things-people-should-stop-giving-so-many-fucks-about) and fish for attention
* Your blog will always be 100% your content with the best visibility -- no need to optimize hashtags or be desperate about getting featured
* Your photos can be shown in large sizes -- you're not restricted to the tiny thumbnails of various social media platforms

## What to expect from this blog?

Personally, I'm expecting this blog to be a great experience. Blog posts allow for a variety of new types of curated content: I can show series of multiple images and describe the thought process that went on while taking the photos, peek into work-in-progress photos that I find challenging to post-process, analyse photos that I'm not happy with and explain why, and more.

I have a faint guess that this blog will have less content about gear than usual, and instead focus more on the thoughts and processes. During my years in photography I've seen an abundance of quality discussion on equipment, but found the content about photographic content, processes and the human element more difficult to find.

In case this blog manages to evoke any thoughts, questions or suggestions, feel free to email me -- I'd be glad to reply.

To end with the obvious: this blog will have plenty of photos. Enjoy!
