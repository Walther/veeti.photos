On this Saturday evening, I wanted to try my hand at some landscape photography. I dug my tripod from under the sofa and went for a walk under the setting sun.

The following two shots are of a tree nearby that has been challenging me for a long time. I'm still not quite happy with the results - I don't feel like I've captured and represented its beauty to the fullest extent. The surroundings provide extra challenge: behind the tree, there's a bus stop and an entire building with highly reflective air conditioning devices. If you try to shoot the tree from the best angle, the building inevitably creeps to the frame. These two photos are taken slightly from the side, leaving the building to the right side of the frame. However, you can't quite see how beautifully the tree has died off 50/50 along its trunk, creating a gorgeous, contrasty divide between its left and right sides. I'd love to hear your suggestions.

Along my walk I found another interesting scene - a tuft of grass on a rocky beach, the moon behind some hazy clouds, and dark water for texture. However, photographing it was extremely difficult - I took over a hundred shots around this location. How to compose - what to include, what to exclude? How to expose - go for a softer, wider aperture with fast shutter speed, or get more things in focus with a stopped down aperture, at the cost of motion blur? These four shots are the best of that bunch, but I'm still not sure if any single of them is actually great.

While heading back home, the sun had set almost completely. The strong wind had created these long, stripey clouds, almost resembling aurora borealis.

As an afterthought: my tripod is full-sized, but with aluminum legs and mostly plastic everything else - including the head. I think it cost like 30 euros back some time ago. In all honesty, it's quite horrible compared to some of the tripods out there. However, it was really cheap, and I've only used it a handful of times during many years. Sometimes you don't need the best gear - especially for something you rarely ever use.
