Why do I shoot film? Why should you shoot film? What is it good for?

Shooting film encourages you to attempt different kinds of shots. With film, you have a limited amount of frames and each frame will cost you processing time and money for the next roll. This encourages you to take 10 different shots instead of 10 times the same shot. Walk around, play with the composition and think -- how to make the most out of what is there?

Thinking in black and white helps you see the play of light and shadows. When I saw this scene I was intrigued: beautiful heathers, and the completely dried-out, pale grass around them. The heathers would be the foreground and main subject of the photo, and the highly reflective grass would give some backround interest. The small branch of a growing tree completes the shot as an aside or a flourish.

Shooting film lends itself for self-reflection. It's a bit more meditative, there's a certain zen to it. You can't chimp at a screen and you know you won't see the photos until hours later by the earliest, or more likely, some days in the future. It becomes natural to focus on the moment. Breathe, watch your thoughts float by. Make more photos.

Shooting film is a way to self-express, among thousands of others. It's quite as valid as any other -- pick one that suits you and enjoy.

Don't get stumped on irrelevant questions. At the end of the day, film isn't better or worse than digital. Create more art.
